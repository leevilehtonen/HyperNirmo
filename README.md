Hyper Nirmo is a 2D physics-based jumping game. Your goal is to jump from box to box. Show your skills and beat the record! Try to get as far as possible without hitting the spikes. It may feel easy but be aware, the speed is increasing, which makes the game a lot more difficult. Also be aware the game is really addictive.
